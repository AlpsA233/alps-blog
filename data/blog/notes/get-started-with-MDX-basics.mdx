# What is MDX?

MDX is a markdown syntax extension that allows you to write React components in your markdown. It's a great way to combine the best of both worlds - the simplicity of writing markdown with the power of React.This allows you to embed dynamic content and interactive components in Markdown.

# Getting Started

## Installation

To get started with MDX, you'll need to install the necessary packages. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install --save @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/loader
```
or
```bash
yarn add @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/loader
```

## Configuration

To use MDX with Next.js, you'll need to configure the `next.config.js` file. Here's an example configuration:
```js
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/
}
module.exports = withMDX({
    pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
}
```

## Writing MDX

Create an MDX file: Under the pages directory, create a .mdx file, such as blog.mdx.

```mdx
// pages/blog.mdx
import Layout from '../components/Layout'

# My Blog

Hello World.

<Layout>
  <p>This is an example of using a custom component.</p>
</Layout>
```

## Custom Components

You can create custom components to use in your MDX files. For example, you can create a Layout component that wraps your content in a layout.
```js
// components/Layout.js
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid #ddd', padding: '20px' }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Rendering MDX

To render an MDX file, you can use the `getStaticProps` function in Next.js. Here's an example:
```js
import fs from 'fs'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'
import Layout from '../components/Layout'
export default function Blog({ source }) {
}

## Running the App

To run the app, you can use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
